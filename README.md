<h3 align="left">I'm a Founding Engineer at Usawa Care, building the future of health tech.</h3>



Cool stuff but clearly not as exciting as Usawa Care:
- On a previous life (a few months ago) I was a Tech Lead at Halo, a Unbabel project, doing Full-Stack + iOS engineer.
  - We've been on the Web Summit main center stage and at the United Nations AI for Good Global Summit. We've recently announced a partnership with **OpenAI**.

- I won, twice, the **Apple Swift Student Challenge Award**.
- :mortar_board: I have a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (I did a master's thesis in Computer Vision), and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Iscte University. Yes, I'm a geek :computer:.
- ðŸ“š I have a big passion for **Design** and **Delightful Interactions**, I'm currently working on some cool projects!
- I did a Frontend Summer Internship at Unbabel and also worked as an AI summer intern at EDP.
